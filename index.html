				<section data-markdown>## GraphQL federation on the edge</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## GraphQL Federation: WHY?
					![start](./images/start.png)

					- This is where all applications start

					- Perfect for simple application

					- Great to have a unified view of the data
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## THE MONOLITH

					![monolith](./images/monolith.png)

					- As the application grows, it starts to tangle more and more

					- Multiple teams working on it, with risk of type duplications, and moving slower

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## BFF

					![bff](./images/bff.png)

					- Good developer experience, domain separation

					- Duplicate effort, missing an unified view of the data

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Apollo Federation: Concepts

					![federation-gateway](./images/federation-gateway.png)

					- The gateway is the entry point of each request and coordinates all the subgraphs

					- What is a subgraph? It's an instance of @apollo/subgraph. For example, In SE we got disco, se and assessment subgraphs
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Apollo Federation: Concepts

					![subgraphs](./images/subgraphs.png)

					- In a federated architecture multiple subgraphs are federated into a single "supergraph" on the gateway

					- Easy to merge different types, but what about extending?

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Apollo Federation: Entities

					![drilling-disco](./images/drilling-disco.png)
					- An entity is an object type that you define in one subgraph and you extend and reference in other subgraphs

					- In apollo, you can define an entity by using the `@key` directive

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Apollo Federation: Entities

					![directives](./images/directives.png)

					- SE subgraph extends the type from Disco

					- SE needs also resolvers for the fields it provides
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Apollo Federation: Entities

					- Merged type in federation

					![drilling-federated](./images/drilling-federated.png)
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Apollo Federation: Concepts
					![federation](./images/federation.png)
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## INNER WORKINGS

					![entities](./images/entities.png)

					- Transforming the server to a subgraph, it will provide a _service and a _entities query

					![union-entity](./images/union-entity.png)

				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## How data is queried

					![example-query](./images/example-query.png)

					- We query for any type specifying the required keys and the typename

					- Use the `...on` sytax to query the fields of the specific type

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## So are we using apollo federation?

					- Only on the subgraphs, the gateway is using @graphql-tools stitching

					- Reasons: smaller bundle size & less bloated, more powerful, runs smooths on workers

					- Compatible with apollo federation (not to be confused with the "old" stitching)

				</section>
<!--				<section data-markdown>-->
<!--					## How does graphql-tools stitching works?-->

<!--					- Remote schemas that threats remote endpoints as if they were local executable schemas-->

<!--					![fifty](./images/remote-schemas.png)-->

<!--				</section>-->
<!--				<section data-markdown>-->
<!--					## How does graphql-tools stitching works?-->

<!--					- Stitching schemas together will create a single schema like on apollo federation-->

<!--					- Some minor conversion needed for the directives-->

<!--					![fifty](./images/stitching.png)-->

<!--				</section>-->
<!--				<section data-markdown>-->
<!--					## Full stitching example-->

<!--					![full-stitching](./images/full-stitching.png)-->
<!--				</section>-->
				<section data-markdown>
					## Pitfalls
					![fifty](./images/requires.png)

					- Think about the federation when designing queries and entities, you could easily trigger multiple subgraph requests

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Pitfalls

					- Avoid breaking changes, with federation you could break the graph for everyone

					- Be careful about enums, interfaces, inputs with the same names (we have some things in place to prevent this)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>## Cloudflare</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Cloudflare workers: Pros

					- All the serverless goodies (autoscaling, easy deployments, global network)

					- 0ms cold start

					- Edge storage KV builtin

					- 1/10th the cost of other serverless platforms
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Cloudflare workers: Differences

					- Does not support lots of node builtin modules (so we had to reimplement things like apps insights)

					- Testing environments required some work (ie: kv mocks, call interception, cron tiggers...)

					- Still cutting edge, so more functionalities added, tooling changes, best practices not obvious etc.
